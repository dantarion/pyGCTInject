pyGCTInject
===========

> This program takes a NTSC (other region support? TODO) .dol from the the game Super Smash Brothers Brawl
> and injects everything needed to embed a Ocarina GCT into it. It injects the GCT, codehandler, and a block 
> of assembly that performs the gameconfig.txt patches.

Uses
========
> Running an extracted ISO of Brawl using Dolphin emulator, with a codeset of your choice. This has been used by 
> Dantarion to test file modifications for Project M for a while, and now it is out in the WILD!
